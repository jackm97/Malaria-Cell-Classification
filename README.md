# Malaria-Cell-Classification
Image classification model to identify Malaria infected cells and healthy cells. Model is trained from the NIH [Malaria dataset](https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/). 

Model is currently in development. This is a first attempt at programming a neural network from near scratch and further training/parameter tuning is needed. Currently the network is able to produce ~70% accuracy. To improve accuracy, a CNN may need to be adopted.
